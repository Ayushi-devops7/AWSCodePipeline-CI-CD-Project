# **CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Application using AWS Services** 

## **Project Overview**
This project showcases a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application. By leveraging AWS services, Docker containerization, and automation tools, it ensures a seamless workflow for development, testing, and deployment. The pipeline highlights efficient cloud infrastructure practices, high scalability, and minimal operational overhead.

---

## **Key Achievements**
1. **Containerization with Docker** 
   - Developed and containerized a Node.js application for consistent cross-environment performance.

2. **Automated Build with AWS CodeBuild** ðŸ”§  
   - Configured AWS CodeBuild to build Docker images automatically on code changes.

3. **Workflow Automation with AWS CodePipeline**  
   - Streamlined CI/CD processes, automating build, test, and deployment workflows.

4. **Deployment with AWS ECS (Fargate Mode)** 
   - Deployed the application on a serverless container platform for high scalability.

5. **Defined Build Steps with buildspec.yml**  
   - Automated the build and deployment process with a configuration file.

6. **Version Control Integration with GitHub**   
   - Ensured reliable tracking and deployment of code changes with GitHub integration.

## **Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **1. Containerize the Node.js Application**
- Write a `Dockerfile` to define the environment for the application, specifying:
  - The base image (e.g., `node:14`).
  - Instructions to copy application files, install dependencies, and define the entry point.
- Build the Docker image locally using `docker build` and verify that the containerized application runs as expected.
- Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR) if testing before automation.

---

### **2. Set Up AWS CodeBuild**
- Go to the AWS Management Console and create a new CodeBuild project.
- Link the project to your GitHub repository to monitor code changes.
- Write a `buildspec.yml` file to define the build steps:
  - Install required dependencies using `npm install`.
  - Build the Docker image with `docker build`.
  - Authenticate and push the Docker image to Amazon ECR using `docker push`.

---

### **3. Create a CI/CD Workflow with AWS CodePipeline**
- Create a new pipeline in AWS CodePipeline:
  1. **Source Stage**: Connect your GitHub repository to the pipeline. This ensures the pipeline triggers whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
  2. **Build Stage**: Add a CodeBuild action that uses the `buildspec.yml` file to build the Docker image and push it to Amazon ECR.
  3. **Deploy Stage**: Set up an ECS deployment action to pull the Docker image from ECR and deploy it to your ECS cluster.

---

### **4. Deploy the Application with AWS ECS (Fargate Mode)**
- Create a new ECS cluster in Fargate mode via the AWS Management Console.
- Define a task definition that includes:
  - The Amazon ECR Docker image as the container image.
  - Resource specifications such as memory and CPU for the container.
- Set up an ECS service to manage the container deployment, ensuring high availability and automatic scaling.
- Test the deployment by accessing the application through the ECS service endpoint.

---

### **5. Automate the Process**
- Test the entire pipeline by pushing a code change to the GitHub repository.
- Monitor the pipeline stages (Source, Build, Deploy) in the AWS Management Console to ensure successful execution.
- Validate that the updated application is deployed and accessible.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Automated CI/CD Workflow**: Integration, build, test, and deployment processes are fully automated.  
- **Containerization with Docker**: Ensures consistent application behavior across environments.  
- **Serverless Deployment with AWS ECS**: Effortless scaling and zero server management overhead.  
- **Version Control**: Reliable and traceable deployment process using GitHub.  

---

## **What I Learned**
- **AWS Service Integration**: How to connect AWS CodeBuild, CodePipeline, ECS, and ECR for a unified CI/CD workflow.  
- **Automation with buildspec.yml**: Writing efficient build scripts for automation.  
- **Containerization Best Practices**: Ensuring reliable and portable deployments using Docker.  
- **Scalable Deployments**: Leveraging Fargate for serverless and scalable infrastructure.
